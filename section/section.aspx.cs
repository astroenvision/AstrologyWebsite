Also consideration of weeping of child or first inhalation by child or in the hands of Nurse etc, which is exact birth of timeout of all these is also a big question.&nbsp;<br />Whereas in Horary,&nbsp;either the Querent is writing the exact time of Query and or Astrologer is noting the time of Query.</p><p><strong>g)</strong> Precise &amp; Clear:&nbsp;Horary is more precise and clear in Prediction and final results</p><p><strong>h)</strong> Limitations:&nbsp;Natal cannot answer for questions about Relationship, Lost Article, Missing person, Pregnancy, Travel, Disease, A desired wish to happen or not etc whereas the Natal can&rsquo;t answer such Questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally:&nbsp;My Horary Master &lsquo;Pandit J.N.

The answer from me was &quot;Yes&quot; and I will be getting an appointment letter from my new employer same evening. You said fine and we will meet tomorrow. Next day when we met I guess you did not ask me the same question as probably you knew the answer BUT instead asked me if I had my &quot;Patri&quot;. I guess in 2 meetings you knew most of me by reading my palm at a distance. Eventually after going through my horoscope you helped me to continue in the same company that I was about to leave, as I did not end up getting any appointment letter from the new employer. More so you had already foreseen that there was no possibility of me getting another job for another 2 months if I left my present employer.<br /><br />I guess I am fortunate enough to continue learning a lot from your wisdom, thoughts and things that you foresee with utmost clarity in advance whether it is related to profession, personal, family, near and dear ones affected by my being around them etc.<br /><br />I have been in constant touch with you for long now and it amazes me how your astro predictions are so accurate and amazingly correct.<br /><br />From Bottom of my heart THANKS ONCE AGAIN!!!</p><p><strong>Puneet Sawhney<br />Vice President - MNC</strong></p>";

It goes as far as the mid- 1980s when we worked together. Over these years his guidance and support in to my family and me at all times is beyond words. His extraordinary insight into Astrology, Herbal medicine and Gemology and his ability to combine the best of these disciplines has over the years proved invaluable to me and my family. Till today we co nsult him on almost every important issue and regard his views and opinions with utmost respect.<br /><br />Hari's deep knowledge and understanding of the Hindu Shastras makes his advice and predictions even more accurate and he can also advise alternative methods like reciting mantras and reading chalisas to solve a lot of physical ailments and other problems. A very fitting example would be when I had complained of a terrible shoulder and arm pain, Hari had suggested that I read Hanumanji's Bahuk every Tuesday and Saturday. I have been doing it diligently for several years now and have been free of the pain problem since then. There have been many more instances over the years where his knowledge and acumen has always been extremely helpful to us and will be always sought for in the future.

You cheered us in good times and warned and guided us in other times. You advised us to do, as they should be done. You never hesitated from calling a spade a spade. When we were on the wrong path, you got us back on the right one. So much so that even today I believe there is a kind of telepathy between us.

Every prediction has been correct sometimes even to the day.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would say that you are our saviour and god has ordained us to be asociated with you since it was HIS wish that you guide us always throughout our lives.We wish all success to you in your endeavours and may God grant you his wisdom so that you are forever with us and forever guiding us in our lives.
